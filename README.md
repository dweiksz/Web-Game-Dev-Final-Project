# Web-Game-Dev-Final-Project

About Our Project:
Our project draws inspiration from games such as flappy bird, and the dinosaur game on Chrome. We have both always found these kinds of games extremely entertaining when bored, and simple to understand. Given the nostalgia had surrounding these kinds of games, and their addictive nature; we knew we had to make our own version.

How to Play:
Like these games, the objective is not to hit any obsticles. The longer you last, the higher your score. Controls are operated with the arrow keys on the keyboard. To add a level of increasing difficulty, the obsticles start to approach the player at a faster rate as time progresses.
